00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.360
Monica, I think Rachel's here.

2
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.600
I mean, like, give it up for me,
Chipin, I broke up.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Oh, I want to know what happened.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.440
Well you know who my parents are out
of town and Chip was going to come over.

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.440
Yeah.
Yeah.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.800
And you going to give you you flower.

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.640
Can you just call it sex?

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.680
It really creeps me out
when you call it that.

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.360
Oh, and by the way, while we're at it, a
guy's thing is not called his tenderness.

10
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.720
Believe me.

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.480
Show you these, sweetheart, they oh.

12
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.120
Everyone, this is Chandler,
my roommate and lead singer of our band.

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.960
Oh, this is Monica,
I'm Ross's little sister.

14
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.600
Oh.

15
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.720
I'm so glad you could come.

16
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.040
We got plenty of food.

17
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.720
I hope you're hungry.

18
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.320
Chandler hates Thanksgiving
and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving for.

19
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
Oh.
Oh, I'm so glad you brought him here then.

20
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.280
Chandler,

21
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.080
if you want, I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

22
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.120
Well, as long as the Pilgrims
didn't need it that Ayman.

23
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.920
Emek.

24
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.480
So

25
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
rage, does it does it feel weird around

26
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.240
here now, you know,
since I've been away at college?

27
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
Oh, no, not really.

28
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.640
Let's call.

29
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.440
So.

30
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.880
I cannot believe Chip dumped me
for that slut, Nancy Branson.

31
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.040
I am never going out with him again,
you know, I don't care how much he begs.

32
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.880
I think his bag and days are over now.

33
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.040
He's going out with Nancy Branson.

34
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.160
You know what?
I just had it with high school boys.

35
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.800
They are just silly.

36
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.440
They're just silly.

37
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.240
Stupid boys start dating men.

38
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.440
But I'm sorry, Judy, I couldn't find
that both you and Jack were looking for

39
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.000
call them mom and dad, you lose loser.

40
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.920
What a cook.

41
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.680
Hey, Chandler.

42
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.000
Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Oh, yeah, it was great.

43
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.640
Should be a chef.

44
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.400
OK.

45
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.280
Yes,

46
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.600
all this stuff about Nancy Branson being
a slut was all a rumor,

47
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.080
so Chip dumped her and he wants
to come over to my house tonight.

48
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.720
Oh, that is so great.

49
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.480
Oh, God.

50
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.760
If you and Chip do it tonight.

51
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.000
Promise me you'll tell me everything.
Oh, totally.

52
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.400
Totally.
You know, it's not that big a deal.

53
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.520
We already kind of did it once, you know.
I know.

54
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.040
But, you know,

55
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.760
it's time we got to definitely know
whether or not you did it, you know,

56
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.120
and you promised that this time it would
last, at least for an entire song.

57
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.760
So I'm thinking of asking Rachel out
tonight, you know,

58
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.680
maybe playing her that song we wrote
last week, motional knapsack right on.

59
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.200
Oh, but don't take too long, OK, because,

60
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.520
you know, we're going to test out
our fake I.D. tonight, right?

61
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.040
Clifford Alvarez,

62
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.360
listen, role in changingthings go well.

63
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.760
I may be out with her all night.

64
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.120
Dude, don't do that to me.
I know.

65
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.560
It's cool.
You can stay here.

66
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.160
My parents won't mind.
No, it's not that.

67
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.280
I just want to be stuck here
all night with your fat sister.

68
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.760
Hey.

69
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.800
Monica, why don't you finish off these

70
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.320
guys, I don't have any
more room in the fridge.

71
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.880
Oh,

72
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.160
no, thank you.

73
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.720
Well, Judy, you did it.

74
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.440
She's finally full.
